# ConVeX: Context-aware Dataset for Collaborative Perception in Autonomous Driving

ConVeX is a large-scale, multi-agent, multi-modal synthetic dataset designed to support research on collaborative perception (CP) for autonomous driving, with a specific focus on robustness under adverse weather and lighting conditions.

The dataset systematically captures the same driving scenes under varying environmental conditions, enabling controlled and rigorous evaluation of perception algorithms.
